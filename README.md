# chess
lets create my favorite game
Growing up, my dad would buy us board games which helped boost our thinking capabilities, slowly started with drafts but later 
on my older brothers introduced me to chess.
I figured out it was more intruiging compared to the other games and I grew fond of it. I think it highly contributed to my love
for mathematics since my primary levels up to date.
Thanks to a youtuber named Eddie Sharick whose tutorials I keenly followed, my dream as a kid was fulfilled and I was able to build
my own Chess AI following his tutorials.
Disclaimer: My AI wont go easy on you!!

In this game, you basically play with the white side against the AI as this is the default setting. Changing this is pretty easy as 
is would only take changing the boolean values in line 54 and 55 of the ChessMain.py. The part is as follows:
    player_one = True  # if a human is playing white, then this will be True, else False
    player_two = False  # if a human is playing white, then this will be True, else False
    
After configuring it to your desired settings, whether it's you versus AI, AI vs AI, or you vs a real player, run the ChessMain.py file 
and enjoy your game!
